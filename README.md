Points taken care of:
1. The user name field only accept an email format and the validation is done through Javascript.
2. The password field is a masked field i.e. it does not reveals what the user is entering.
3. The password field does not accepts any special character other than '@' and only gets accepted when it contains an uppercase letter and a number.

Whenever any incorrect email is entered, such an alert is shown ![image](https://github.com/RAHULSAINI830/Zentradestask2/assets/96569692/c46f32bb-bed9-4501-ad5f-17c37203cb30)


Email is only accepted if it is in the valid format i.e. it must contain one '@' and one '.' indicating an email being valid.

Whenever any incorrect password is entered, such an alert is shown ![image](https://github.com/RAHULSAINI830/Zentradestask2/assets/96569692/f25d028c-ad7f-42d0-bae1-bc3f2927253d)


In the end when email and password both are entered in correct format an alert showing 'Login Succesful!' displays. ![image](https://github.com/RAHULSAINI830/Zentradestask2/assets/96569692/562c9ee1-7e4b-4dba-8abc-5ab7dbb47e84)
